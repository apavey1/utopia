##About
Utopia is a lightweight, free extension for your ad-blocking software that intuitively whitelists trusted news sites while retaining all the functionality you know and love everywhere else. In other words, *you'll only see advertisements on the news websites that desperately need your support-* not clickbait, Facebook, or Twitter.

##Install
Utopia is available today in an alpha version for AdBlock Plus, and support for more ad-blocking platforms is in the works. Once you finish the installation process, you'll receive automatic updates adding new media outlets, bug fixes, and more - essentially, you can install it and forget about it.
1. **Make sure you're using a compatible browser.** Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox Mobile, SeaMonkey, Yandex.Browser, and Thunderbird are supported.
